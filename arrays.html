      <h2>Introduction to Arrays</h2>
      <p>An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array
        index or key. It is used to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays in data structures help solve
        some high-level problems like the "longest consecutive subsequence" program or some easy tasks like arranging
        the same things in ascending order. The concept is to collect many objects of the same kind.</p>

      <h2>What Are Arrays in Data Structures?</h2>
      <img src="Arrays_in_ds-what-is-array-img1.png" alt="array image">
      <p>In the context of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), an array is a fundamental data structure that stores a
        collection of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array is accessed by
        its index or position.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Fixed Size:</strong> Arrays have a fixed size, meaning the number of elements they can hold is
          determined when they are created. This size cannot be changed dynamically during runtime.</li>

        <li><strong>Contiguous Memory Allocation:</strong> Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations,
          which means the elements are stored one after the other in memory. This property allows for efficient memory
          access, as elements can be accessed directly using their indices.</li>

        <li><strong>Indexing:</strong> Elements in an array are accessed using their index. The index is typically a
          non-negative integer that represents the position of the element within the array. The index of the first
          element is usually 0, and the index of the last element is one less than the size of the array.</li>

        <li><strong>Random Access:</strong> Arrays support random access to elements, which means any element can be
          accessed directly by its index in constant time (O(1) time complexity).</li>

        <li><strong>Homogeneous Elements:</strong> Arrays can only store elements of the same data type. For example, an
          array of integers can only hold integer values, and an array of characters can only hold characters.</li>

        <li><strong>Static vs. Dynamic Arrays:</strong> Some programming languages support dynamic arrays, which can
          resize themselves dynamically to accommodate more elements if needed. Dynamic arrays typically use a resizing
          strategy (e.g., doubling the size when full) to efficiently manage memory.</li>

        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Arrays are widely used in various algorithms and applications, including
          sorting algorithms (e.g., insertion sort, merge sort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), dynamic
          programming, representing matrices, and more.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why Do You Need an Array in Data Structures?</h2>
      <p>Arrays are an essential data structure in computer science and are widely used for several reasons:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Efficient Access:</strong> Arrays provide constant-time access to elements based on their indices.
          This means that accessing any element in the array requires only a single operation, regardless of the size of
          the array. This efficiency makes arrays suitable for applications where fast access to elements is crucial.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Memory Efficiency:</strong> Arrays use contiguous memory allocation, meaning that elements are
          stored one after the other in memory. This memory layout is efficient in terms of space, as it minimizes
          overhead and allows for efficient memory access patterns. Additionally, arrays have a fixed size, which can
          lead to better memory management compared to dynamic data structures.</li>

        <li><strong>Sequential Storage:</strong> Arrays are ideal for storing elements that have a sequential or linear
          relationship. For example, arrays are commonly used to represent sequences of data such as lists, queues, and
          stacks. The sequential storage provided by arrays makes it easy to traverse elements sequentially or perform
          operations on them iteratively.</li>

        <li><strong>Index-Based Access:</strong> Arrays allow for direct access to elements using their indices. This
          index-based access enables efficient random access to elements, which is crucial for many algorithms and
          applications. For example, arrays are often used in sorting and searching algorithms that require random
          access to elements.</li>

        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Arrays can store elements of the same data type, but they can also be used to
          represent more complex data structures by storing references or pointers to other data structures. This
          versatility allows arrays to be used in a wide range of applications, from simple lists to more complex data
          structures like graphs and trees.</li>

        <li><strong>Efficient Iteration:</strong> Arrays facilitate efficient iteration over elements, as they provide
          direct access to each element based on its index. This property makes it easy to traverse the entire array or
          perform operations on all elements in the array without the need for additional data structures or overhead.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Below are some examples of arrays in different programming languages:</p>

// Python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

// Java
int[] myArray = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};</code></pre> <br>
