        <h2>Introduction to Graphs</h2>
        <p>A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of vertices (also called nodes or points) and edges (also called links or lines) that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects.</p>
        <p>Here are some key concepts related to graphs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vertices (Nodes):</strong> These are the entities in the graph, represented as points.</li>
          <li><strong>Edges (Links):</strong> These are the connections between vertices, represented as lines or arcs.</li>
          <li><strong>Directed Graph:</strong> A graph in which the edges have a direction associated with them, indicating a one-way relationship between vertices.</li>
          <li><strong>Undirected Graph:</strong> A graph in which the edges do not have a direction associated with them, indicating a two-way relationship between vertices.</li>
          <li><strong>Weighted Graph:</strong> A graph in which each edge has a numerical value associated with it, called a weight, representing some kind of cost or distance.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjacency:</strong> Two vertices are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.</li>
          <li><strong>Degree:</strong> The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Graphs are widely used in computer science, mathematics, and various other fields to model various real-world scenarios such as social networks, transportation networks, computer networks, and more. They have a wide range of applications in algorithms, data structures, optimization, and network analysis.</p>

      <h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
      <div class="graph-type">
        <h3>Undirected Graph</h3>
        <p>An undirected graph is a graph in which edges have no direction. That is, the edge (u, v) is identical to the edge (v, u).</p>

      </div>

      <div class="graph-type">
        <h3>Directed Graph (Digraph)</h3>
        <p>A directed graph is a graph in which edges have a direction. That is, the edge (u, v) is different from the edge (v, u).</p>

    <section id="graph-representations">
      <h2>Representations of Graphs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjacency Matrix:</strong> A two-dimensional array where the value at index (i, j) represents whether there is an edge between vertices i and j.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacency List:</strong> A collection of lists where each list represents the vertices adjacent to a particular vertex.</li>
        <!-- Add more representations as needed -->
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="graph-traversal">
      <h2>Graph Traversal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> Explores all the vertices in a graph level by level.</li>
        <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.</li>
        <!-- Add more traversal algorithms as needed -->
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="graph-algorithms">
      <h2>Graph Algorithms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shortest Path Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph, such as Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms to find a subset of edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all edges in the tree is minimized, such as Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.</li>
        <!-- Add more graph algorithms as needed -->
