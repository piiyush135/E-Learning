      <h2>Introduction to Linked Lists</h2>
      <p>A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can dynamically adjust their size during runtime by allocating memory as needed.</p>

      <h2>What Are Linked Lists in Data Structures?</h2>
      <img src="linked-list image.png" alt="linked list image">
      <p>In the context of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), a linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.</p>

      <p>Key characteristics of linked lists:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Size:</strong> Linked lists can dynamically adjust their size by allocating memory for new nodes as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Node Structure:</strong> Each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Traversal:</strong> Traversing a linked list involves sequentially visiting each node, starting from the head node.</li>
        <li><strong>Insertion and Deletion:</strong> Linked lists support efficient insertion and deletion operations, as nodes can be easily added to or removed from the list by updating the references.</li>
        <li><strong>Types:</strong> There are various types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists, each with its own characteristics and use cases.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Do You Need a Linked List in Data Structures?</h2>
      <p>Linked lists offer several advantages over other data structures, making them suitable for various applications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Size:</strong> Linked lists can dynamically adjust their size, making them ideal for scenarios where the size of the data structure is unknown or may vary over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Insertion and Deletion:</strong> Insertion and deletion operations in linked lists have a time complexity of O(1) when performed at the beginning or end of the list, making them efficient for dynamic data manipulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory Efficiency:</strong> Linked lists use memory efficiently by allocating memory for new nodes only when needed, unlike arrays, which require contiguous memory allocation.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Linked lists can be easily modified and rearranged, making them suitable for implementing dynamic data structures such as stacks, queues, and associative arrays.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Types of Linked Lists</h2>
      <p>There are several types of linked lists, each with its own characteristics and use cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Singly Linked List:</strong> In a singly linked list, each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Doubly Linked List:</strong> In a doubly linked list, each node contains a data element and references to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence, allowing for efficient traversal in both directions.</li>
        <li><strong>Circular Linked List:</strong> In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Sorted Linked List:</strong> In a sorted linked list, nodes are arranged in ascending or descending order based on their data elements.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Operations on Linked Lists</h2>
      <p>Common operations performed on linked lists include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Traversal:</strong> Visiting each node in the linked list sequentially.</li>
        <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> Adding a new node to the linked list.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Removing a node from the linked list.</li>
        <li><strong>Searching:</strong> Finding a specific node in the linked list.</li>
        <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Arranging the nodes in ascending or descending order based on their data elements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits of Using Linked Lists</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic size adjustment</li>
        <li>Efficient insertion and deletion</li>
        <li>Memory efficiency</li>
        <li>Flexibility in data manipulation</li>
        <li>Support for various data structures and algorithms</li>
